        ThingsBoard (TB) turned out to be a great match to build our Agricultural IoT platform. 
        First and foremost because of the extremely skilled and service minded architects behind it. 
        Together with the TB developers several new features were added to the platform for our needs, 
        among these the Asset system and PostgreSQL support. 
        These new features gave us the possibility to model our data structure using only TB as the backend, both on the multi-tenant cloud server and on-premise installations.
        The real time UI system proved useful both in development phase and for our final user interface. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Using TB as our platform allowed us to rapidly achieve a very genetic solution that will serve our scaling needs for years to come.
